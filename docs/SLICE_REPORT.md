## M1 Ground — built 2026-09-03

### Built

- **Tile layer** (`packages/sim/src/tiles.ts`, run name `M1-tiles`): a pure derivation of the block map. 32×32-tile cells, 24×24 lots inside 4-tile margins (so streets are 8 wide where two margins meet), the 768×768 city, row 23 river under a 4-tile embankment street. Rubble 250–350 tiles per block, typed by district (civic stone, residential copper, industrial steel), five density variants, three clusters per lot, denser on deeper blocks. Outskirts: no rubble; one cell in four carries a 160-tile iron or coal deposit. Standing rubble is `round(tiles · pool ÷ poolMax)` and digs out thinnest-first as the block's pool drains. `cellKey(state, rubbleLeft)` is the renderer's cache key; `describeTile` feeds the tooltip. Nothing in the tile layer writes to the block sim: the map view's block state is authoritative, as the constitution requires.
- **World view** (`packages/game/src/worldScene.ts`, `view.ts`, `main.ts`; the proto package renamed `packages/game`): Phaser Blitter over a code-drawn 29-frame tileset, per-cell cache on `cellKey`, block-state overlay on lots, cell labels, HUD pinned at screen scale, drag / WASD pan, wheel zoom 0.5–3× about the pointer, tile tooltip, HQ slab. **E** toggles map ↔ world at the same block (map → world takes the hovered block, world → map takes the block under the camera centre and marks it). `?view=world` opens in the world view. The sim is stepped from Phaser's `STEP` event in either view, so the map-view bot and fixtures run unchanged underneath.
- **Tests:** six in `packages/sim/test/tiles.test.ts` — geometry, river and inert, rubble counts and types, gradient, authority of block state, determinism and cost. `npm test`, `snapshot:check` (map-view fixtures), `docsync:check`, `experiments`, lint, typecheck, and the game build are green.

### Assumed (every `GAME-ASSUMPTION` in M1 code)

| # | Where | Assumption | Resolves at |
|---|---|---|---|
| GA-M1-1 | `tiles.ts` | Rubble count is uniform in 250–350 per cell by hash; district and depth change the density variant, not the count. | Phase 5 (rubble as finite typed ore) |
| GA-M1-2 | `tiles.ts` | Outskirt lots carry no rubble; one outskirt cell in four holds a 160-tile deposit, iron three times in five, coal otherwise; no oil field; deposits are not consumed (the block sim has no outskirt pool). | Phase 9 sites (D-P4-3) |
| GA-M1-3 | `tiles.ts` | Rubble sits in three gaussian clusters per lot (σ 6 tiles) so a lot reads as heaps with clear ground between, as in the §18 sketch. | Phase 12 art pass |
| GA-M1-4 | `tiles.ts` | Density variant = 1 + round(4 · (0.55 · rank in heap + 0.45 · depth)), depth being `dmax` over the district base from 0 at the start to 1 at +50 %. | Phase 5 (E11/E13) |
| GA-M1-5 | `tiles.ts` | Digging order is thinnest heap edge first, with standing rubble proportional to the block pool; M2's excavators replace it with their footprints. | M2 |
| GA-M1-6 | `tiles.ts` (implied) | Units per rubble tile are not modelled: a tile is 1/N of the block's 3,840-unit pool, not §12's 300 units. | D-P4-2, Phase 5 |
| GA-M1-7 | `worldScene.ts` | Zoom range 0.5–3× per the constitution; §4 edited to match. | D-P4-1 |
| GA-M1-8 | `worldScene.ts` | Flat block-state overlay on lots stands in for rot presence (M4) and the light texture (M5). | M4 / M5 |
| GA-M1-9 | `worldScene.ts` | HQ is a 6×6-tile slab at the start lot's centre until M2 places the Depot. | M2 |
| GA-M1-10 | `worldScene.ts` | Code-drawn flat-colour tileset frames stand in for the §4 tilesets; the frame table is the contract. | Phase 12 |
| GA-M1-11 | `main.ts` (implied) | No 20 ticks/s tile tick yet: M1 has nothing that moves at tile level, so the sim still steps in 1 s block ticks from the render loop. | M2 |

### Deferred

Excavators and footprints → M2; slot count as lot geometry → M2 / Phase 5; the §18 lot sketch from the world view → M3 (needs turrets and belts); rot as tile presence → M4; light texture → M5; tileset art → Phase 12; deposits as placed facilities → Phase 9. All in `DEFERRED.md` with a phase.

### Measured

- **Tile derivation cost:** `cityTiles` for all 576 cells, cold, 51–66 ms (tileset and layouts built once); re-deriving all 576 cells against the cache, 2 ms. Per city over seeds 3/4/5: ≈102–103k rubble tiles, 8–10k deposit tiles.
- **View checks (headless Chromium, canvas 648×648):** 529 tiles drawn at 1×, 1,849 at 0.5×, 81 at 3×; tooltips on rubble (type and density), ground, street, and the river; E round-trips at the same block by keyboard and API; console clean.
- **Render loop, 30 s samples (in-page RAF sampler; Phaser's delta is smoothed and is not the honest number):** 4× static and 16× roaming both 1,800 frames, mean 16.67 ms, worst 16.7 ms, none over 50 ms.
- **The first 1 h at 4× soak failed, and not on render cost.** At sim 0:02:47 the map scene threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'state')` from the game's `STEP` handler, Phaser's loop stopped, and the sampler degraded to 66 ms frames with a frozen clock. Cause: `MapScene` took its session from Phaser's `init(data)`, which never runs for a scene added asleep (`?view=world`); the first sim event handed to the sleeping scene dereferenced it. Fixed by passing the session through the constructor, as the world scene already did. This is the kind of thing the constitution's soak rule exists to catch.
- **1 h at 4× soak after the fix** (seed 3, `?view=world&autoplay=compact`, camera roaming to a random block every 5 s cycling 0.5/1/2/3/1.5×, bot claiming):
  | Measure | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Real time | 900 s |
  | Sim time reached | 1:00:07 |
  | Frames (RAF sampler) | 53,998 |
  | Mean frame | 16.67 ms (60 fps) |
  | Worst frame | 66.7 ms, one frame, at the moment a headless screenshot was captured mid-run |
  | Frames over 50 ms | 1 (that one) |
  | Frames over 33 ms | 2 |
  | Camera moves | 180 (random block every 5 s, zoom cycling 0.5/1/2/3/1.5×) |
  | Bot (compact) | 4 claims, 4 held, 0 lost, 0 interior at the hour |
  | Errors | none |

  Phaser's own smoothed delta over the same run: 53,997 frames, worst 21.7 ms, none over 50 ms. The render loop was not dropped: the one long frame is the screenshot tool's capture, and the sim clock ran the full hour at 4× in 900 s of wall time. **Constitution check met.**

### Where M1 and the doc disagree (reported, not resolved)

- Zoom: constitution 0.5–3×, §4 said 1.0–0.2×. Built 0.5–3×, §4 edited to it. **D-P4-1.**
- Rubble units: §12 says 300 units per tile; the sim's calibrated pool is 3,840 per block, which would be 11–15 units per tile. **D-P4-2.**
- Deposits: §7/§12 name placed mines and seams on the outskirts; M1 hashes a patch onto a quarter of outskirt cells. **D-P4-3.**
